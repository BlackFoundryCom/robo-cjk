BUG:
- Protect the non-compatibility of an atomic element (remove print)
- Remove abilty to duplicate of Atomic Element in Deep Component sources (remove print)


TO ADD:
- Collaboration engine to set up with lock/unlock (GIT? SQL? â€¦)
- Variable Font generation with decomposition of Deep Components
- Factorisation of deep components (lower quality of design, for smaller file size)

- Display all Character Glyphs using a Deep Component at its creation (to make the extremes of DC directly in CG)
- Creating Character triggers Deep Components Creation


NICE TO HAVE:
- Powerruler
- Use anchor to set tranformations origins of Atomic Element instance in Deep Component
- Undo not working
- Glyphs-lists better control of Add and Delete (choose name, focus to item)
- Rectangle on scale tool
- Remove focus ring on editbutton on composition rule window
- memo values

DONE:
- Bug refresh preview after renamed deep component axis
- Bug rename axis on deep component
- Interpolation bug with scale
- Shift on copy/Paste for different layer
- Filter on sheets
- size of buttons + - in canvasGroups
- Sensibility of scale in transformation tool
- scale 1000/1000
- List coord higher in popover
- icone transformation tool
- remove multi deep component
- Remove axis on atomic element
- Enable modification of the DB (customisation, errors fixing etc.)
- Filter glyphs field
- Link HanGlyphComposition DataBase (public git repo) 
- Disable 'save project' and 'new project' while no git repo is loaded
- Color for clockwise contours
- Transformation tool
- Fontlib + fontInfos in storage file 
- Select a deep component while dragging with selection tool
- Multiple selection of items in glyph window
- Search glyphs
- Default glyph width
