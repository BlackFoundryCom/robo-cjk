BUG:
- Protect the non-compatibility of an atomic element (remove print)
- Remove abilty to duplicate of Atomic Element in Deep Component sources (remove print)

TO ADD:
- Fontlib + fontInfos in storage file 
- Select a deep component while dragging with selection tool
- Variable Font generation with decomposition of Deep Components

- Glyphs-lists better control of Add and Delete (choose name, focus to item)
- Link HanGlyphComposition DataBase (public git repo) and enable modification of the DB (customisation, errors fixing etc.)
- Display all Character Glyphs using a Deep Component at its creation (to make the extremes of DC directly in CG)
- Creating Character triggers Deep Components Creation
- Search / filter glyphs field
- Collaboration engine to set up with lock/unlock (GIT? SQL? â€¦)


NICE TO HAVE:
- Multiple selection of items in glyph window
- Use anchor to set tranformations origins of Atomic Element instance in Deep Component
- Disable 'save project' and 'new project' while no git repo is loaded
- Undo not working
- Preview of selected glyph in the List (AE, DC, or CG) in the main window
